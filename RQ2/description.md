We want to investigate how often code errors or code quality issues appear in the AI agents pull requests. More specifically, we want to explore what kind of errors or issues are most common amongst the AI agents. If we have extra time, we will explore the possible reasons as to why such code issues occur frequently in AI agents.
  
**Methodologies:**  
  There are several methods that can be used to retrieve problematic PRs and the details surrounding them. Such PRs can be retrieved by querying the pr_review and pr_review_comments tables for records with ‘body’ content that resemble keywords or text related to code issues, and with a ‘CHANGES_REQUESTED’ state. Similarly, the pr_comments table can be examined in an identical way to find more code issues. This is amongst some of the techniques that will be used to obtain the data that relates to agent code issues, we can compare the count of these issues to the total PR records to determine the rate and frequency at which code issues are made. From the body content of these records, we can extract the issues into certain categories based on keywords and obtain metrics for the most common issues. Pie charts and graphs will be constructed in python to help visualize and compare these various metrics and form our conclusions.
